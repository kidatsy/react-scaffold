## React Scaffold
This is a basic scaffolding to get started with a new React project without the bloat and faff of CRA. It includes the following:
- Redux
- Redux-saga
- Lodash
- Flow
- ESLint
- Jest

### Fire it up
1. Run `npm start`
2. Go to `localhost:8080`

### Static Analysis
#### Flow
Flow is like TypeScript but more incremental. You can specify which files to include in the analysis by adding the `//@flow` decorator at the top of any file. Analysis can be run by issuing:

```shell
npm run flow
```

#### ESLint
ESLint is set up. You can run it with:

```shell
npm run lint
```
